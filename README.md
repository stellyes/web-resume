# Web Resume

---

Welcome to this module's Challenge! This is an even-numbered module, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This module, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you'll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you'll use during your job search. It's a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

_note_

If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course. However, at least one application should be live, so you can add the deployed application from the Module 01 Challenge or that module's deployed mini-project.

Let's look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.

## User Story

    AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Mock-Up

## How to Complete the Challenge

Follow these steps to complete the challenge:

1. Use the Acceptance Criteria as a guide for how you'll plan deadlines, sketch, and code your portfolio.
2. Ensure that your work meets the Acceptance Criteria and the full list of grading requirements.
3. Reach out to your instructional support team throughout the module for help.
4. Follow submission instructions.

## Grading Requirements\_

If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:

- A repository that has no code
- A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
- A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
- A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

- Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria.

### Deployment: 32%

- Application deployed at live URL.
- Application loads with no errors.
- Application GitHub URL submitted.
- GitHub repository contains application code.

### Application Quality: 15%

- Application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the Challenge instructions.

### Repository Quality: 13%

- Repository has a unique name.
- Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
- Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
- Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
- Repository contains a quality README with description, screenshot, link to deployed application.

## How to Submit the Challenge

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

- The URL of the deployed application.
- The URL of the GitHub repository that contains your code. Give the repository a unique name and include a README file that describes the project.

_note_

You are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate. If you complete all Challenge assignments, your lowest two grades will be dropped. If you wish to skip this assignment, click Next, and move on to the next Module.

Comments are disabled for graded submissions in BootCamp Spot. If you have questions about your feedback, please notify your instructional staff or the Student Success Advisor. If you would like to resubmit your work for an improved grade, you can use the Resubmit Assignment button to upload new links. You may resubmit up to three times for a total of four submissions.

**important**

**It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo**. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a Challenge or any aspect of the curriculum, please remember that there are student support services available for you:

1.  Office hours facilitated by your TA(s)
2.  [Tutoring Guidelines Links to an external site.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hTldEfWhX21B_Vz9ZentkPeziu4pPfnwiZbwQB27E90/edit?usp=sharing) (schedule a session in the "Tutor Sessions" section of Bootcampspot)
3.  AskBCS Learning Assistants
